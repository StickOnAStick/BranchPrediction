When running parallel_test.py or test_parser.py, place them in a folder with champsim (not inside the champsim folder)

When using Test_parser to graph tests, make sure the tests you want to graph are in the Trace_tests folder
If you want to save a Trace_test, but don't want to graph it, then move to the Trace_test(storage) folder
